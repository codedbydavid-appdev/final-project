# To-do list
x Filtering by reading time, rating, hashtags, ... on articles page [using Randstack]
--> update: filtering basic on index page done; to-do is filtering by average rating, filtering on non-index page and hide/show filters beyond hashtag
x searching on all pages with printed articles (also hashtags, articles, publishers, favorites, bookmarks)
x user page
--> update: done
x index view for publishers, favorites and hashtags
x log-in page (make it appealing)
x groups
x share articles with individual people only
--> update: link with whatsapp, so private messages or platform-specific groups are not required
x public/private profiles
x follow (other users, potentially topics, authors and sources)
x video presentation; beyond Youtube
x log in with Facebook?
x when typing hashtags, give Instagram-style preview of existing tags (with html datalist)
x use JS ajax to not re-load pages when action is executed
x change to multi-view (many posts in a screen, e.g. 2x4)

The idea is simple: create a platform that enables its users get hold of the most impactful and valuable content from news stories to deep-dive insight reports. Instead of relying on algorithmic matching, we are convinced that - given that current state of artifical intelligences - thoughtful recommendations by like-minded people proof most powerful in identifying content that is relevant and customized. At KnowledgeSwipe (name is still tbd, very open to suggestions), you can manage your entire thirst for knowledge and new content in one platform, from seeking the very best articles and studies to keeping everything organized in the most neat and convenient way. It's our goal to become your go-to source of knwoeldge and information!

The current state of our platform is basically a V0.01, the very first beta we have been working on. While our intention may sound great in thought, we want to test its usability and feasibiltity in real-life circumstances. For that, we invited you (and some others) to become the initial (test-)users of KnowledgeSwipe. Everyone that was selected at this early stage tends to have some interest in digital topics - may it be machine learning, self-driving cars, software development, robotics or any other topic. We think that having a common topic will help to kickstart the communication on the platform and improve the experience to every one of you (despite the rather small size of our community for now). Accordingly, it would be amazing if you can focus your activity on KnowledgeSwipe on these topics for now. Also, please try to share minimum two articles a week and be as present with likes, comments, ratings, ... as possible - it would definitely be appreciated!

We tried to make the user flow as self-explaining as possible, but we'll share some basic instructions anyway. There is no follow/friend functionality yet, so basically everyone with an account on the plaftform is in your community. Under Newsfeed (homepage), you can see all the content posted by either user in chronological order. By clicking on any hashtag, author or source link or using the focus dropdown, you'll be redirected to the specific detail pages. Using the bookmark and favorite icon on the bottom right of the image (or the buttons on the bottom using the modal view when clicking on the title), you can add/delete content to/from your personal bookmarks and favorites. Your personal profile can be accessed using the button in the top right showing your username. After all, we guess most (or hopefully all) things we be self-explaining. If not, feel free to text David.

On a last note, since this is the very first beta, things are far from perfect. Don't be afraid to let us know about all the errors you find and potential improvements you perceive, we are definitely open for any kind of feedback. To simplify this, there is a form under Community -> Give some feedback, feel free to use it as often as you desire.
